<objective>
A versioned JSON Prowl operation result or one correlated terminal delegation handback, with complete public identities and checked command status preserved verbatim.

<operation_surface>

The source-owned operation names are:

| Operation    | Arguments                                                                                           | Mutation authorization |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `list`       | none                                                                                                | no                     |
| `agents`     | none                                                                                                | no                     |
| `read`       | one selector; optional `last`, `waitStable`, stability bounds                                       | no                     |
| `send`       | one selector, `text`; optional `noEnter`, `noWait`, `capture`, `timeout` with the constraints below | no                     |
| `key`        | one selector, `key`; optional `repeat`                                                              | required               |
| `focus`      | one selector                                                                                        | required               |
| `tab-create` | optional selector and `path`                                                                        | required               |
| `tab-close`  | one selector; optional `force`                                                                      | required               |
| `pane-close` | one selector; optional `force`                                                                      | required               |
| `open`       | optional `path`                                                                                     | no                     |

A selector is exactly one of `target`, `worktree`, `tab`, or `pane`. Preserve its complete public value. For `send`, `capture` cannot combine with `noEnter` or `noWait`, and `timeout` cannot combine with `noWait`. The adapter always requests public JSON and owns every Prowl command token and flag.

</operation_surface>

<workflow>

1. Interpret `$ARGUMENTS` as one low-level operation, one delegation request, or one terminal handback. When it is empty, require a concrete operation before running the adapter.
2. For `list`, `agents`, `read`, `send`, or `open`, build this source-owned request shape and set only arguments the operation accepts:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "operation": "agents",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

For `open`, set `operation` to `open` and set `arguments` to either `{}` or `{"path":"<complete-source-supplied-path>"}`. Treat both forms as non-mutating and never add `mutationAuthorized`.

3. For `key`, `focus`, `tab-create`, `tab-close`, or `pane-close`, require an explicit user instruction authorizing that exact external mutation in the same turn. When authorization is absent, use `AskUserQuestion` with the exact operation and complete target identity; do not run the adapter. After authorization, add `"mutationAuthorized": true` inside `arguments`.
4. Submit a low-level request over stdin.

When the shell accepts multiline input:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/prowl_environment.py" run <<'JSON'
{"schemaVersion":1,"operation":"agents","arguments":{}}
JSON
```

When the runner requires one physical command line:

```bash
printf '%s\n' '{"schemaVersion":1,"operation":"agents","arguments":{}}' | python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/prowl_environment.py" run
```

5. Accept only `status: "succeeded"`. Preserve the complete versioned result, `commandExitCode`, and public `response` values. Stop with the exact `status` and `detail` on `command-failed`, `invalid-schema`, `prowl-unavailable`, `mutation-unauthorized`, or `operation-unavailable`.
6. For bounded delegation between two identities returned by `agents`, submit this shape to `delegate`:

```json
{
  "sender": {
    "agent": "<complete-agent-id>",
    "pane": "<complete-pane-id>",
    "worktree": "<absolute-worktree-path>",
    "branch": "<complete-branch>",
    "repository": "<absolute-repository-root>",
    "run": "<complete-run-id-when-present>"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "agent": "<complete-agent-id>",
    "pane": "<complete-pane-id>",
    "worktree": "<absolute-worktree-path>",
    "branch": "<complete-branch>",
    "repository": "<absolute-repository-root>",
    "run": "<complete-run-id-when-present>"
  },
  "subject": "<bounded subject>",
  "instruction": "<complete bounded request>",
  "coordinationReference": null
}
```

The result carries the complete source-owned `delegation` envelope. Preserve it for the terminal handback; transport success is not acceptance or completion.
7. The recipient submits exactly one terminal result to `handback`, carrying the original `delegation`, one `kind`, and one supported result form:

- `delegation-completed`
- `delegation-failed`
- `delegation-rejected`
- `delegation-unavailable`

A complete inline result uses `inlineResult`. A durable result uses `resultReference` plus a bounded `projection`; both forms may appear together. The adapter rejects a missing result, a reference without projection, and a conflicting terminal handback.
8. Return the complete terminal result to the delegating workflow. Do not poll the recipient, add acceptance or progress phases, or infer completion from pane output.

</workflow>

<constraints>

- ALWAYS preserve complete source-supplied agent, pane, worktree, branch, repository, run, coordination, status, conclusion, exit-code, and result-reference values.
- ALWAYS execute the bundled script through `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`; never import it from another filesystem location or manufacture a path outside this skill directory.
- NEVER invoke raw Prowl commands, Prowl command help, or an external environment-control skill.
- NEVER mutate focus, keys, tabs, or panes without explicit authorization for the exact operation and target in the same turn.
- NEVER scan transcripts, parse terminal presentation as identity, or poll for delegation completion.
- NEVER make retry, checkpoint, persistence, result-interpretation, or continuation decisions for another workflow.

</constraints>

<testing>

Before release, import the bundled module with controlled `CommandRunner` implementations under the interaction-protocol and failure-simulation exceptions. Cover every operation mapping, public JSON success and failure, exact participant projection, mutation rejection before command construction, delegation result forms, repeated terminals, conflicting terminals, malformed input, missing Prowl, and CLI stdin dispatch.

</testing>

<failure_modes>

**A selectorless tab creation was rejected.** Claude applied the shared selector requirement to `tab-create`, even though the public operation accepts both selectorless and selected forms. The shared request builder hid the operation-specific shape. Build `tab-create` from its declared optional-selector contract and preserve optional `path` independently.

**An advertised operation had no construction branch.** Claude listed `open` in the public surface but grouped only list, agents, read, and send into the non-mutating workflow. Executors then had to infer the request shape. Keep every advertised operation in an explicit construction branch; `open` accepts empty arguments or one source-supplied `path`.

</failure_modes>

<success_criteria>

- A successful public operation is mechanically established only when the bundled script exits zero and emits `schemaVersion: 1`, `status: "succeeded"`, `commandExitCode: 0`, and a public `response` object without exposing Prowl command grammar.
- Every positively identified Prowl participant retains complete public identities verbatim.
- Every delegation preserves its initiating coordination reference through exactly one completed, failed, rejected, or unavailable terminal handback.
- Terminal results carry complete inline content or an exact durable reference with a bounded projection.
- Unauthorized focus, key, creation, and closure requests fail before Prowl runs.
- No workflow polls, invokes help, or depends on a separate environment-control skill.

</success_criteria>
