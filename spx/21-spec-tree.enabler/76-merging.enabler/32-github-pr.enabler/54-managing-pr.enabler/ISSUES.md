# Issues: PR Managing Protocol

## 1. Worktree-safe branch-deletion default lacks eval coverage for the deletion mechanism (FOLLOW-UP)

The `managing-pr.md` merge-command scenario declares two observable branch-deletion behaviors: the overlay-silent default runs the worktree-safe deletion sequence (`gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch=false`, then detach this worktree onto the refreshed base tip and delete the local and remote branches separately), and an overlay MAY opt into inline `gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch` for always-single-worktree projects. The `merge-command-overlay-precedence` eval verifies only the merge-strategy flag and its source; no case exercises the deletion mechanism.

Required handling when an eval-coverage sweep happens:

- Add a scenario assertion to `managing-pr.md` (or extend the merge-command scenario) declaring the deletion-mechanism choice as a separately observable behavior.
- Create `evals/merge-cleanup-deletion/` with a verdict schema carrying a deletion-mechanism field, exercising the overlay-silent worktree-safe path and the single-worktree inline opt-in.
- Run the eval to populate `history.jsonl`.

Surfaced by the local `changes-reviewer` gate on `fix/worktree-safe-branch-deletion` (2026-06-07).
