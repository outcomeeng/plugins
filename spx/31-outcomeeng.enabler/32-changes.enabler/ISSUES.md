## DEBT [capability]: unused author-change verification grants

Defect class: `capability`.

Finding: `author-change` grants `Bash(spx verification run input:*)`, `Bash(spx verification run status:*)`, and `Bash(spx verification run render:*)`, although its delegating workflow does not use them.

Evidence: `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/author-change/SKILL.md:8` declares all three grants, and the hosted review at [PR #583](https://github.com/outcomeeng/plugins/pull/583#issuecomment-5730664407) identified no corresponding invocation in the workflow.

Impact: the skill carries excess capability beyond the authority required by its delegating workflow.

Successor: the Proposed Change filed after Change #89 merges for the agent-run-journal sequence collision, carrying this defect as its second item.

Revisit and settlement condition: remove all three unused verification-run grants and pass one typed skill audit over the revised `author-change` surface.

## DEBT [specificity]: author-change leaves four checks and one workflow unnamed

Defect class: `specificity`.

Finding: the typed skill audit of `author-change` on the Change Lifecycle changeset (head `a28a5be91fc2ea04151c283059caa9cb9a11fd12`) found the audit gate not naming which granted `spx verification run` command establishes `terminalStatus`, the rendered projection, and retained-input equality; the split and coalesce lineage operations routed to a workflow no bundle names; the structured-question tool unnamed and ungranted where the body asks the operator; and two success criteria ("carries the required authority", "Continuation depends only on…") without a named check.

Evidence: `instructions:skill-auditor` findings f-010, f-012, f-013, f-014 on `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/author-change/SKILL.md`. The second skill-audit pass on the three Lifecycle skills added: `release-change` step 3 carries six stop-capable operations in one paragraph (f-009), a candidate for numbered sub-steps. The relaunch of the `change-standards` audit added: `SKILL.md` calls the references "rules and no procedure" while `lifecycle.md` carries command forms (f-008), and its first success criterion is not observable at load (f-010). The typed skill audit of `change-standards` on the Proposed-readiness changeset (head `98e924f4f88200425e649c3034f6fb0336f2bcf8`) raised the same "no procedure" claim again: `SKILL.md:30` states that the shared references own the rules and no procedure while `lifecycle.md` carries command-bearing rules, and the same sentence's inventory of `lifecycle.md` omits its `canonical-state` rule (f-009, `WARNING`). The typed skill audit of `author-change` at that head again found no step naming the `spx verification run` command that establishes the audit-gate checks (f-009, `WARNING`).

Impact: the gate's checks and the lineage operations rest on judgment where a named command or workflow would make them falsifiable, and a reader of the `change-standards` loading contract receives an inaccurate account of what `lifecycle.md` contains.

Successor: the Proposed Change filed after Change #89 merges for the `author-change` grants (entry above), carrying these as further items.

Revisit and settlement condition: each check named against its granted command, the lineage workflow named or the operation stopped with a named result, the structured-question tool named and granted, the `change-standards` loading contract describing its references' content accurately with every `lifecycle.md` rule in its inventory, and one typed skill audit of each skill approving with no `specificity` finding.

## DEBT [single-location]: change-standards states one requirement in more than one place

Defect class: `single-location`.

Finding: the first success criterion of `change-standards` states that each record requirement has one canonical statement in the shared reference, while the Definition of Ready tables restate requirements the shared `change-record.md` rules already state: `proposed-input-boundary` restates `received-input-boundary`, and `framed-authority` restates the Intent attestation text the `frame` rule carries.

Evidence: `instructions:skill-auditor` finding f-011, severity `WARNING`, against `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/change-standards/SKILL.md:36`, in the typed skill audit of `change-standards` on head `98e924f4f88200425e649c3034f6fb0336f2bcf8`.

Impact: the `change-standards` success criterion cannot be met as written, so an auditor judging the skill against it either raises the restatement again or accepts a criterion the bundle does not hold. A restated requirement can drift from its other statement without any check reporting the split.

Revisit and settlement condition: either each Definition of Ready criterion that restates a shared rule cites that rule by its identifier instead of restating its text, or the success criterion states the relation the bundle actually holds between shared rules and Maturity criteria; one typed skill audit of `change-standards` then raises no finding against those statements.

## DEBT [precondition]: the Change skills assume a GitHub store without stating the precondition or a blocked result for another store

Defect class: `precondition`.

Finding: `change-standards` `lifecycle.md` rules `canonical-state` and `inert-stdin` read and write the Change store through `gh` against GitHub Issues and a GitHub Project without stating that store kind as a precondition or naming the result for a store of another kind; `author-change` persistence uses `gh` for the GitHub store the coordination overlay declares and names no result when that overlay is absent or declares a store of another kind.

Evidence: `instructions:skill-auditor` finding f-012, severity `WARNING`, against `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/change-standards/references/lifecycle.md:11`, and finding f-008, severity `WARNING`, against `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/author-change/SKILL.md:92`, in the typed skill audits of `change-standards` and `author-change` on head `98e924f4f88200425e649c3034f6fb0336f2bcf8`.

Impact: a consumer repository whose coordination overlay is absent or declares a non-GitHub store reaches `gh` commands the store cannot answer, with no stated blocked result, so the failure surfaces as an opaque command error instead of a named precondition.

Revisit and settlement condition: each of the two skills states the store kind its commands require and names the blocked result for a store of another kind, `author-change` also naming it for an absent overlay as `lifecycle.md` `store-binding` already does; one typed skill audit of each skill then raises no `precondition` finding.

## DEBT [adr-pdr-compliance]: the audit-change runner is a generic shipped script beyond fifty lines

Defect class: `adr-pdr-compliance`.

Finding: `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/audit-change/scripts/audit_change_run.py` is a generic shipped script far beyond fifty lines, which `spx/12-shipped-scripting.adr.md` holds as debt awaiting extraction of its logic into the SPX CLI once the script proves its value, or removal when it does not.

The `change-auditor` definition `src/plugins/spec-tree/agents/change-auditor.md` has no retained release-acceptance evidence: `spx/15-subagent-execution.pdr.md` declares release acceptance per supported harness as native loading plus one minimal isolated execution for each of its Standard, Strong, and Fast profiles. Release acceptance belongs to the release, so the changeset that introduces the definition, Change outcomeeng/changes#162, runs no paid invocation.

Evidence: `spec-tree:implementation-auditor` run `2026-09-29_08-34-14-821-c605096fd926` raised a `debt` finding under rule `adr-pdr-compliance` against the runner; `wc -l` over the runner derives its current length, so this entry carries no line count. `instructions:subagent-auditor` finding `f-002`, verdict `REJECT`, class `evidence/missing-invocation-evidence`, judged `src/plugins/spec-tree/agents/change-auditor.md` on head `02c847e66b2f526804db14eb568fae2a2180b858`.

Impact: the runner's state, branching, and result contracts ship inside a plugin that a consumer repository cannot version independently or repair without a marketplace release. No execution claim stands for the `change-auditor` definition on any harness or profile until release acceptance retains its evidence.

Revisit and settlement condition: once the runner proves its value in use, its logic moves into the SPX CLI, tested there and consumed by the plugins product as a trusted third-party component, leaving `audit-change` its instruction and no script; a runner that does not prove its value is removed rather than extracted. The definition's gap settles when release acceptance retains, for every supported harness, native loading and one minimal isolated execution of each Standard, Strong, and Fast profile, judged by an independent Auditor with no retry or substitution after a failed or unusable launch.
