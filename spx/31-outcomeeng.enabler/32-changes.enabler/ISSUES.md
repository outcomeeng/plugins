## DEBT [capability]: unused author-change verification grants

Defect class: `capability`.

Finding: `author-change` grants `Bash(spx verification run input:*)`, `Bash(spx verification run status:*)`, and `Bash(spx verification run render:*)`, although its delegating workflow does not use them.

Evidence: `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/author-change/SKILL.md:8` declares all three grants, and the hosted review at [PR #583](https://github.com/outcomeeng/plugins/pull/583#issuecomment-5730664407) identified no corresponding invocation in the workflow.

Impact: the skill carries excess capability beyond the authority required by its delegating workflow.

Successor: the Proposed Change filed after Change #89 merges for the agent-run-journal sequence collision, carrying this defect as its second item.

Revisit and settlement condition: remove all three unused verification-run grants and pass one typed skill audit over the revised `author-change` surface.

## DEBT [specificity]: author-change leaves four checks and one workflow unnamed

Defect class: `specificity`.

Finding: the typed skill audit of `author-change` on the Change Lifecycle changeset (head `a28a5be91fc2ea04151c283059caa9cb9a11fd12`) found the audit gate not naming which granted `spx verification run` command establishes `terminalStatus`, the rendered projection, and retained-input equality; the split and coalesce lineage operations routed to a workflow no bundle names; the structured-question tool unnamed and ungranted where the body asks the operator; and two success criteria ("carries the required authority", "Continuation depends only on…") without a named check.

Evidence: `instructions:skill-auditor` findings f-010, f-012, f-013, f-014 on `src/plugins/spec-tree/skills/author-change/SKILL.md`.

Impact: the gate's checks and the lineage operations rest on judgment where a named command or workflow would make them falsifiable.

Successor: the Proposed Change filed after Change #89 merges for the `author-change` grants (entry above), carrying these as further items.

Revisit and settlement condition: each check named against its granted command, the lineage workflow named or the operation stopped with a named result, the structured-question tool named and granted, and one typed skill audit approving with no `specificity` finding.
