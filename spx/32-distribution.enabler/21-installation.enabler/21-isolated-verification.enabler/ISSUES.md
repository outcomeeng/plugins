# Installation evidence gaps

## The L3 installation evidence stalls on a Full Disk Access prompt

Running the repository-installation L3 evidence launches the real Claude Code and
Codex CLIs. On macOS that spawn requests `kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles` and
`kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAppBundles` through the invoking shell, so a machine that
has not yet answered that request shows a modal Full Disk Access dialog and the
test blocks until the operator dismisses it.

The dialog names the *responsible* application — whichever agent harness hosts the
session — not the test, the shell, or either agent CLI. Nothing identifies the run
as the cause, so the observed symptom is `just verify-marketplace-installation` or
`just check` hanging for minutes with no output and no failure.

**Evidence.** With the permission already denied the requests still appear and the
run completes normally: `accessing={TCCDProcess: identifier=com.apple.sh}`,
`responsible={the host application}`, `service=kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles`,
`authValue=0`. A bare shell, `just`, `uv`, and `git` produce no TCC activity at
all, so the request originates in the agent-CLI spawn rather than the toolchain
around it. Observed while the gate appeared to take twelve minutes; the same gate
measures 11m13s once the decision is cached.

**Resolution shape**: decide whether the evidence can prove installation without
the permission surface — the agent CLIs may only need it for features these runs
never exercise — and otherwise state the prerequisite where a developer meets it,
so a first run fails fast with the reason instead of stalling on an unattributed
dialog. Neither the denial nor the grant changes the result: the evidence passes
with the request refused.

**Revisit condition**: before onboarding documentation claims a clean first-run
gate on macOS, or when a contributor reports the gate hanging with no output.
