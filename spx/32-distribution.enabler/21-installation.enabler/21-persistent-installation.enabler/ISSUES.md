# Installation evidence gaps

## The unpublished-plugin enable wording is unobserved

`_is_pending_publication` in `outcomeeng/distribution/installation.py` classifies a failed plugin install or enable as pending publication when `UNPUBLISHED_PLUGIN_FRAGMENT` — the literal `not found in marketplace` — appears in the lower-cased stderr. The simulated stimuli in `outcomeeng_testing/harnesses/installation.py` carry the independently transcribed real **install** wording for both CLIs, observed while adding the `contribute` plugin against a canonical marketplace that did not yet publish it:

```text
Claude Code: Failed to install plugin "contribute@outcomeeng": Plugin "contribute" not found in marketplace "outcomeeng".
Codex:       Error: plugin `contribute` was not found in marketplace `outcomeeng`
```

A constant that drifts from that captured wording now fails the linked tests. Neither **enable** message was ever observed: the Claude plan issues install then enable per plugin, and the first observation run stopped at the Codex install before any enable ran. The fragment also carries no per-agent prefix, unlike `CLAUDE_ALREADY_INSTALLED_FRAGMENT`, so the enable wording remains unverified for both CLIs.

If either enable message words the absence differently, the carve-out silently never engages for that operation and the run fails where it should report pending.

**Resolution shape**: build a disposable marketplace fixture that omits a plugin the built tree ships, register it as the source in the isolated homes the installation harness already provisions, and run the real `claude` and `codex` CLIs against it to record the install and enable wording for both. That is a new real-CLI evidence lane with its own fixture, not a change to an existing test, which is why it is not folded into the changeset that surfaced it.

**Evidence**: raised by changeset review `2026-08-09_10-14-46-352-325b0ceb84d5` against the changeset that introduced the carve-out.

## Cross-plugin agent-home cleanup is reachable only through the maintainers' installer

`spx/32-distribution.enabler/21-installation.enabler/12-installation-state.pdr.md` separates a plugin's namespace-bounded
placement from marketplace-scope reconciliation — the pass that prunes
definitions of plugins later removed or renamed from the catalog under the
marketplace's recorded ownership. The shipped `place_agents.py` implements only
its own plugin's namespace; the marketplace-scope pass lives in
`outcomeeng/distribution/installation.py` and is reachable solely through
`just install-marketplace` in this repository. An ordinary consumer whose
`$CODEX_HOME/agents/` carries a definition for a plugin the catalog no longer
publishes has no shipped path to prune it: the definition stays until the
consumer removes it by hand.

The retired plan for this node proposed embedding a committed-catalog snapshot,
stamped with a deterministic catalog revision, in each plugin's shipped tree so
any single plugin's lifecycle skill could run the marketplace-scope pass. That
mechanism was not built; the ownership record shipped instead, which lets the
maintainers' installer prune safely but gives a shipped script no view of the
current catalog.

**Resolution shape**: either ship the consumer-reachable marketplace-scope pass —
an embedded catalog snapshot the shipped script consults, or an `spx` command
that reads the marketplace source directly — or narrow the decision's
reconciliation invariant to the maintainers' installer and say so where the
consumer would look for the missing prune.

**Revisit condition**: before a plugin is removed or renamed in the catalog,
since that is the event that leaves a stale owned definition in consumer homes.

**Evidence**: raised by changeset review `2026-08-17_01-03-44-668-0ddd9fe582a1`.
