# Changelog — prose plugin

Prose craft: external prose writing and audit, internal team docs writing and audit.

What changed in **this plugin**, for a consumer repository. An entry appears when a change alters what a consumer can rely on, must do, or must know.

Sections are `Breaking`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Requires`. `Breaking` is separate from `Changed` because a renamed skill breaks invocation outright rather than behaving differently.

## 0.8.0

### Removed

- `Skill` from the lifecycle skill's `allowed-tools`

## 0.7.0

### Added

- **`help` names where the changelogs are.** The lifecycle skill's `help` verb reports this plugin's changelog and the marketplace changelog. Each is read from disk, without network access.

This changelog begins here; earlier history predates the line.
